The Anesthesiology Department at Care & Cure Hospital plays a vital role in ensuring patient safety and comfort during surgical and diagnostic procedures. The team consists of highly qualified anesthesiologists who specialize in administering anesthesia, managing pain, and monitoring vital signs before, during, and after surgery. Their focus is not only on putting patients to sleep for surgery but also on awakening them safely and comfortably afterward.

This department handles pre-operative assessments, post-operative pain management, and specialized care for critically ill patients. Whether it's a complex surgery or a minor outpatient procedure, the anesthesiology team ensures the highest level of patient care with the latest monitoring equipment and medication protocols. They work closely with surgeons and other medical teams to ensure precision and minimize risks.

Moreover, they provide regional anesthesia services like epidurals and nerve blocks, especially useful in orthopedic and obstetric procedures. Their pain management programs are tailored for chronic conditions as well, helping patients lead a better quality of life post-treatment.
